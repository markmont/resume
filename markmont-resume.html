<p>I have been a Research Computing Consultant providing supercomputing support to 1,152 researchers in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of Michigan, August 2012 - March 2018 (full time) and March 2018 - present (part time).</p>

<ul>
    <li>I provide support for a shared cluster consisting of 22,724 cores / 1,371 nodes.</li>
    <li>I am the architect, project manager, technical lead, and programmer for deployment of the <a href="https://connect.arc-ts.umich.edu/">ARC Connect</a> service. ARC Connect allows researchers to easily access scientific applications and interactively collaborate with colleagues on HPC clusters belonging to the University via a simple to use web-based interface.  Major changes that I implemented include:</li>
    <ul>
	<li>I designed and implemented a new authentication system based on Shibboleth (with mandatory multi-factor and InCommon/eduGAIN federation support) and OpenID Connect.  This included writing a new Globus Toolkit user mapping module.</li>
	<li>I designed and implemented a new port forwarding architecture that supports up to 99 VNC or X sessions per node while using a limit number of TCP ports efficiently and scalably.</li>
	<li>I locally patched the TurboVNC server code to require mandatory VNC session encryption while being flexible in terms of which layer the encryption was occurred at (at the VNC layer via the TLSvnc security type, via websockets with HTTPS, or via SSH tunneling), meeting the business requirement for the service while preserving ease of use and choice of VNC client for researchers.</li>
	<li>I implemented support for multiple concurrent ARC Connect VNC sessions, and rearchitected the service to allow sessions to follow researchers across multiple devices and networks.</li>
	<li>I made several major security improvements, including rearchitecting websocket support to avoid exposing web server private TLS keys to researchers, and implementing reverse proxying to enforce encryption and multi-factor authentication for web-based ARC Connect sessions (Jupyter and RStudio Server).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>I provide scientific programming consulting for MATLAB, R, Python, Perl, Fortran, C/C++, and Java.</li>
    <li>I provide scientific application support for over 497 different scientific software packages.</li>

    <li>I wrote a proof-of-concept log analysis program to solve the "swatch rule set problem" by applying Longest Common Subsequence analysis to tokens derived from individual "words" from a log file entry. This solution takes most of the work out of rule set creation and maintenance, making it much more feasible to tightly monitor log events for anomalies.</li>
    <li>I worked extensively with Fedora Linux, with a focus on configuring and managing it for use on servers (service management, advanced firewall configuration, configuration management, log management, monitoring, tripwire, reporting, security lock down and auditing, eliminating traditional password based authentication, and creating SRPMs for local software packages).</li>
    <li>I wrote several new SELinux policy modules, mastered SELinux packet labeling, and gained experience with running servers with no unconfined users. I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/markmont/xt_selinux" target="_blank">netfilter (iptables) module for matching packets based on SELinux contexts.</a></li>
    <li>I worked extensively with the alpha and beta releases of Apache HTTP Server 2.4. I provided support for Apache HTTP Server on the users@httpd.apache.org mailing list. Submitted six patches for Apache HTTP Server trunk to fix various bugs, mostly related to mod_proxy_fcgi.</li>
    <li>I worked extensively with PHP, especially with the PHP-FPM SAPI for FastCGI. Submitted two patches against PHP 5.3.x branch and did a major experimental rewrite of the PHP-FPM code that sets up the PHP environment for requests. I also worked on the APC PHP cache and Suhosin.</li>
    <li>I gained hands-on experience with WordPress.  I used FastCGI (mod_proxy_fcgi + PHP-FPM) for privilege separation, used OpenID and OAuth 2.0 for user authentication and transparent registration, wrote a WordPress plugin for custom Facebook functionality (and learned the Facebook Graph API), and made significant changes to a WordPress plugin for Twitter integration.</li>
    <li>I gained hands-on experience with Drupal and updated my Drupal skills to Drupal 7: I used FastCGI (mod_proxy_fcgi + PHP-FPM) for privilege separation and explored workflow and revisioning in Drupal 7.</li>
    <li>I learned Perl 6, experimenting with Rakudo extensively. I followed Perl 6 and Rakudo development closely.</li>
    <li>I learned Python 2.x and 3.x. I created a Python web application as a proof of concept for an OPIE-based one time password web authentication solution to eliminate the need to use traditional passwords.</li>

      I managed the team providing Unix and Macintosh infrastructure services
      for the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.  I was initially
      hired as the team leader but was promoted to manager in February 1999.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I managed a staff of four Senior System Administrators.  I hired and trained
        new staff, including student temps.  I managed and supervised contractors.
      </li>
      <li>
        I managed 74 servers across 5 server rooms.
<!--
        The team managed 61 production servers, 3 publicly accessible
        test servers, and 10-15 additional non-public test and development
        servers.  The production servers were spread across 5 server rooms
        managed by the team in whole or cooperatively with other groups.
-->
      </li>
      <li>
        I participated in the deployment, maintenance, and support of the
        services provided by the team.
        <ul>
          <li>
            I managed load sets for Linux servers, macOS workstations,
            and Solaris workstations and servers.
          </li>
          <li>
	    I provided high-performance computing services, including managing
	    the projects to propose, purchase, deploy, and support a 17 node
	    Linux Rocks cluster, a 17 node Apple XServe cluster, and a 5 node
	    test Apple XServe cluster.
          </li>
          <li>
	    I was the architect, project manager, and technical lead for the
	    University-wide deployment of the FootPrints web-based request
	    tracking / help desk automation service.
          </li>
          <li>
	    I managed Apache web servers and MySQL database services.
	    <!-- Used for the LSA Classroom
            Database server, the LSA Media Services WebCheckout server, and
	    numerous departmental web servers. -->
          </li> 
          <li>
            I managed DNS and DHCP services for LSA, including the web-based
            administration service for DHCP based on CMU NetReg.
          </li>
          <li>
            I managed the college AFS cell and Kerberos realm.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- <li>
        I provided 2nd and 3rd level support and consulting to department
        IT staff in LSA.  I provided consulting to faculty and department
        business managers in special circumstances.  I ran the monthly
        College-wide Mac/Unix meetings.
	</li> -->
      <li>
        I was the College's technical lead for server room power and cooling.
        <ul>
          <li>
            I was responsible for power and cooling capacity analysis; server
            room facilities planning; rack, UPS, and PDU selection;
            and responding to server room incidents (power outages, cooling
            problems, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            I was a member of the Michigan Academic Computing Center Datacenter
            Operations Committee.  I drafted operation policies,
            consulted on datacenter build-out and construction decisions,
	    served on the physical access and security sub-committee, and
	    drafted rack requirements and standards for datacenter tenants.
          </li>
          <li>
            I provided server space in LSA server rooms to LSA departments and
            wrote and managed the SLAs governing the server hosting.
	    I negotiated MOUs for space rented by LSA in the School of
	    Information datacenter and managed the leased space.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        I assisted LSA departments with interviewing and hiring IT
        staff.  I conducted technical skills assessment interviews.
        I designed and wrote a web-based technical skills assessment
        tool, allowing departments to consider two to three times
        as many candidates in half of the time of in-person skill
        assessments.  I trained new staff on college infrastructure.
      </li>
      <li>
        I managed the team's budget and day-to-day finances.
      </li>
      <li>
        I wrote new service proposals and performed analyses for upper management
        and the LSA Dean's Office.
      </li>
      <li>
        I managed all computing services for the Department of Mathematics
	1999 - 2001.
        <!-- Managed all computing services for a major LSA department for three
        years (in addition to other duties, above).  Deployed 1/2 of my
        team plus contractors to the
        department in order to ensure classes would be able to be taught
        the next term.  Earned the trust of department administration and
	faculty. -->  I worked with department administration to create new
        IT support policies, standards, and expectations.  I replaced the
        majority of the department's servers in
        order to modernize services and solve reliability problems.  I upgraded
        the department's five instructional computing labs and redesigned the
        way the student temps staffed the labs.  I replaced all thin-client
        X terminals in the department with Unix workstations and upgraded
        a large fraction of the desktop machines.  I supported research labs
        with special data storage/management needs.  I hired and trained
	an all-new IT team to support the department long-term, and this new
	team kept the department running smoothly without any problems until
	this model for providing IT support was replaced during a major IT
	reorganization in 2011.
